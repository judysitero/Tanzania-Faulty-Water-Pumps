# Tanzania-Faulty-Water-Pumps

This project focused on creating and improving a model for the Tanazania Water Pump dataset. The goal was to create a model to predict whether a water pump is functional, non-functional, or needs repair.

**The tasks for this project are as follows:**

Task 1: Use wrangle function to import training and test data.

Task 2: Split training data into feature matrix X and target vector y.

Task 3: Establish the baseline accuracy score for your dataset.

Task 4: Build clf_dt.

Task 5: Build clf_rf.

Task 6: Evaluate classifiers using k-fold cross-validation.

Task 7: Tune hyperparameters for best performing classifier.

Task 8: Print out best score and params for model.

**You should limit yourself to the following libraries for this project:**

category_encoders
